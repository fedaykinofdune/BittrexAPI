BittrexAPI, when finished, will be able to make use of all API features of the Bittrex exchange, the first of its kind written in Livecode. This application will be released free of charge, but will not include the automation features planned for a later stage of the project. Feel free to fork it and make your own changes and improvements (and please submit pull requests!), and if you have any feature suggestions, please email me at fedaykinofdune@gmail.com.
