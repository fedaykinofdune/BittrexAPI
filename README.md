BittrexAPI, when finished, will be able to make use of all API features of the Bittrex exchange, the first of its kind written in Livecode. This application will be released free of charge, but will not include the automation features planned for a later stage of the project. Feel free to fork it and make your own changes and improvements (and please submit pull requests!), and if you have any feature suggestions, please email me at fedaykinofdune@gmail.com. 

At this stage it is not usable for anything meaningful except for reference. The core features, such as parsing all the markets, building trade pairs and forming API query URLs (both with and without API-keys) are still being worked out so there's still a mess of text fields everywhere and no documentation. Once it gets nearer to completion, I will try to organize it as sanely as possible and add some code commentary.
